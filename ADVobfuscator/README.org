* IDAPython script deobfuscating ADVobfuscator strings, applied to a TrickBoot sample

The script requires [[https://github.com/fireeye/flare-emu][flare-emu]].
The tested sample is [[https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c1f1bc58456cff7413d7234e348d47a8acfdc9d019ae7a4aba1afc1b3ed55ffa/details][491115422a6b94dc952982e6914adc39]] (TrickBot's UEFI firmware reconnaissance module called "TrickBoot").

Note: We may not be able to reuse it for a different sample that was compiled with a different compiler or with different flags but I think the same approach (decoder function pattern matching + emulation) can be applied.

A result example:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
[*] 0x1000a124: xor2-encoded function detected (size = 0x2f)
[*] 0x1000b92c: emulating from 0x1000b71b to 0x1000b92c
[+] 0x1000b92c: uefi_expl_port_writeDeviceIoControl() ERROR %d
#+END_SRC
