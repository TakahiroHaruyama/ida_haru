* callstrings - deobfuscating Hodur's global string encryption

- Recover strings using various methods (static decoding, emulation, IDA debug hook)
- Apply API function types to the local variable pointers

The script comparison is below:

- As the comparison shows, ida_callstrings_dbg.py and ida_callstrings_flare_emu.py (except emulateSelection) can work for other malware.
- As the reference slides say, it is recommended to use modified [[https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/flare-emu/tree/xorloop][flare-emu]] and [[https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/capa/tree/comment_insertion][CAPA]] to make ida_callstrings_flare_emu.py work better.
